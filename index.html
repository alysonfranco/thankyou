                    Hey, Dany!
                    <br><br>
                    I just wanted to thank you again for the opportunity to interview with you for the Digital Content
                    Producer internship yesterday. Even though we've spoken previously and I've met with other people on
                    your team, it was a pleasure to gain more insight into the role, your team, and your experiences
                    with Universal.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm excited about the possibility of working with such an amazing team and the sense of
                    accomplishment that comes with publishing content to the website. While content production is
                    different from what I'm used to, I'm eager to learn the ropes of CMS systems and Tridion during my
                    time on the team. With the skills I've learned during my current internship and the ones I practice
                    at home and at school, I believe I can support the DigiCon team's goals.
                    <br><br>
                    I also wanted to thank you for making me feel welcome and inviting me to your team outings like when
                    we went to Mardi Gras for lunch. Spending time with your team, as well as witnessing firsthand the
                    reflection of your experiences with your team, has made me enthusiastic about the potential of
                    being a part of it.
                    <br><br>
                    Thank you again for your consideration for this internship. Please reach out if you have additional
                    questions. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.
                    <br><br>
                    Best regards,<br>
                    Alyson Franco
